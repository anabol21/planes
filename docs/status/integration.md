# Integration status

- `review`: сшивка на `cursor/geo-core-kml-stitch`. Тракт рельефа скопирован из `origin/integration/TER-GRI-001` (`src/planes/integration/terrain/`, `opentopography.py`). Разбор KML съёмки и ограничений — `src/planes/integration/kml/`. Браузер отправляет тексты `survey_kml` и `constraints_kml`; третья загрузка препятствий снята. Полигоны ограничений идут в ядро как препятствия: у `MissionInput` отдельного типа запретной зоны нет. Высотный текст копируется и не толкуется. Ключ OpenTopography и скачанные растры в git не входят.

Live path on `main`: form `127.0.0.1:5173`, API `127.0.0.1:8000`, worker `--engine runtime`. The CLI default remains `fake`. SQLite stores the scenario unchanged; catalog numbers are applied only on the listener. `fleet_catalog.json` is filled from Grisha's `data.json`; `geoscan-801` is his 1.5 kg quadcopter. GSD, overlaps, and strip direction come from the form. The form sends `aerodromes` and `boards`, not `pads` or `uav_types`. The listener is `planes-compute.service` at `/opt/planes`, git `da3da56` on `runtime/MIS-002-external-enumeration`, health `live`, contract `v0`, `solver_choice` `meta`. Documentation commit `794fb2d` did not move the listener. Pairs that reach `run()` and the remaining approximations (`geoscan-201` `kh`/`kv`/`kw` `90`/`0.02`/`0.008` instead of `220` W, `turn_time_s` `5.0`, `apply_turn_to_base` `false`, zones and obstacles not copied into `InputData`) are in `docs/architecture/agent-brief-runtime.md` and `docs/architecture/agent-brief-backend.md`.

## Completed

- [x] Terrain tract from `origin/integration/TER-GRI-001`: `src/planes/integration/terrain/opentopography.py` and its package. The geo core was not taken from that branch.
- [x] Server-side KML parser `src/planes/integration/kml/`: survey polygon (EPSG:4326) and constraint polygons (`ring`, `name`, `type`, altitude text copied and not interpreted). The web job sends both file texts. The third obstacle upload is gone.
- [x] Defined non-overlapping workstream boundaries and the initial engine port.
- [x] Added a backend-owned runtime wrapper that converts backend-local v0 requests through runtime-owned parsing.
- [x] Reused `RuntimeEngineAdapter` unchanged for HTTP transport and converted its structured response back to the backend model.
- [x] Added explicit `--engine fake|runtime` worker composition with `fake` as the default.
- [x] Preserved lifecycle mappings: feasible/infeasible to completed, timed-out to timed-out, and error to failed.
- [x] Added deterministic injected-adapter tests without real HTTP calls or secrets.
- [x] Consolidated verified RUS-001, INT-001, and WEB-001 histories on one demo branch.
- [x] Added a Windows-first root quick-start for the API, frontend, fake worker, and optional runtime mode.
- [x] Added small synthetic KML fixtures so a fresh clone does not depend on organizer files.
- [x] Merged `demo/end-to-end-mvp` (`3c1c60c`) onto `main` (`52367c8`). Commits already on `main`, including the optimizer-core docs and Grisha's baseline, stayed.

## In progress

- [ ] Team review and fresh-machine replay from `main`.

## Next action

Review the stitch on `cursor/geo-core-kml-stitch`. The listener on `main` is still the enumeration path in `docs/architecture/agent-brief-runtime.md`. This branch does not deploy it. The three-terminal fake-worker smoke remains the earlier DEMO-001 check.

## Evidence

- Command: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest tests.runtime.test_geo_kml_stitch -v`
- Result: `Ran 4 tests in 21.060s` / `OK`. Parser returns the constraint polygon. Mocked terrain HTTP is used once for the bbox; the cache hit does not call it again. `dem_file` is set. The route does not cross the constraint ring. Missing key and invalid raster fail explicitly.
- Command: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/backend -v`
- Result: `Ran 32 tests in 0.834s` / `OK`.
- Command: `PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/runtime -v`
- Result: `Ran 73 tests in 35.643s` / `OK`.
- Command: `pnpm exec vitest run` in `apps/web`
- Result: 5 files, 52 tests, passed.
- Command: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` in `apps/web`
- Result: exit 0.
- Command: `python3 scripts/validate_workspace.py`
- Result: `Workspace validation: PASS`.
- `docs/architecture/INTERFACES_V0.md`
- `docs/checkpoints/2026-09-22.md`
- Task brief: `docs/workstreams/integration/INT-001.md`.
- `python -m compileall -q src/planes/backend tests/backend` — passed, exit 0.
- `python -m unittest discover -s tests/backend -v` — passed, 32 tests, `OK`.
- `python -m unittest tests.backend.test_runtime_engine -v` — passed, 12 runtime-wrapper tests, `OK`.
- Existing fake worker subprocess test passed separately.
- `PYTHONPATH=src python -m planes.backend.worker --help` — passed and lists `--engine {fake,runtime}`.
- `python scripts/validate_workspace.py` — `Workspace validation: PASS`.
- `pnpm typecheck` — passed, exit 0.
- `pnpm test` — passed, 30 tests across 4 files.
- `pnpm build` — passed with Vite 8.3.0, 21 modules transformed.
- Socket-bound Windows smoke — Vite started at `http://127.0.0.1:5174/`, proxied `/api` to the WSGI API on port 8000, submitted a KML-backed job, displayed `queued`, and displayed the fake-worker terminal `completed` / `FEASIBLE` result with its synthetic-data warning.
- `git diff --check` — passed, exit 0.
- Real VPS smoke was not run: all three required `COMPUTE_*` variables were absent from the worker environment.

## Blockers / limitations

- Real VPS smoke requires out-of-band `COMPUTE_HOST`, `COMPUTE_TOKEN`, and `COMPUTE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`; none were present during verification.
- Runtime server tests are Linux/VPS-only: direct discovery under Windows fails at import because `planes.runtime.lock` intentionally uses POSIX `fcntl`; backend runtime-wrapper tests pass on Windows without changing runtime internals.
- Concrete shared DTO fields and equipment profile provenance remain unfrozen. INT-001 converts between the existing backend-local and runtime-local v0 models without claiming a shared contract freeze.
- Earlier checkpoint text treated `solver body is not implemented` as the live solver result. On `main` the listener calls `run(data, "meta", seed=...)`. That string remains only if `solver.solve` raises `NotImplementedError`. A heuristic result is not globally optimal. `794fb2d` is documentation only and was not deployed to the listener.

## Interface changes and downstream impact

- No change under `src/planes/contracts/**`.
- The job scenario on this branch carries `survey_kml` and `constraints_kml`. The browser no longer sends parsed `area`, `zone_constraints`, or `obstacles` for this tract. Constraint polygons reach the geo core as obstacles because `MissionInput` has no separate no-fly type. Altitude text is copied, not interpreted. Terrain acquisition sets `Params.dem_file`. A missing `OPENTOPOGRAPHY_API_KEY` or an invalid raster fails the job; flat terrain is not a fallback.
- Worker CLI now accepts `--engine fake` and `--engine runtime`; omission remains equivalent to `--engine fake`.
- Runtime mode requires `optimization.objective` and `optimization.time_limit_seconds`; generic backend submission validation is unchanged.
- Runtime transport, runtime internals, infrastructure, shared contracts, frontend, and model code are unchanged.
- Only artifact references returned by runtime are persisted; runtime log contents are not copied into SQLite.
